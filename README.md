Jtfinlay_Notepad is a note-taking application targeted at Android 4.0 or
higher. It provides the user the capabilities to create new notes and provide
a Subject, Date, and Content. These notes are saved automatically when
finished writing the note. Deleting a note is as simple as pressing a button,
and the automatically set date can be edited to whatever the user wills. A
Subject is required for every note.

In addition, this application provides statistics regarding the entries for
the user, such as total characters, total words, total logs, and 100 common
words. To make life prettier, the top 100 words can also be viewed as a word
cloud.

The statistics page and word cloud can be accessed via the Actionbar, and use
only the Content text (ignores the Subject). The log list is sorted by the
creation date, rather than the modified Date value.
